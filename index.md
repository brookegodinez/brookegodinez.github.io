## About Me
Hi! I am Brooke Godinez and I am a second year Masters of Science in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside. My bachelor's degree is in Mathematical Economics from the California State University, San Bernardino. I received my bachelor's degree in May of 2020 and will be finishing my MS in CS in April 2023. My career/academic interests include algorithm design and analysis, software verification and development and learning new programming languages.  

## About My Advisor


My advisor for this project is Yihan Sun, an assistant professor at the University of California Riverside who received her Phd from Carnegie Mellon University. Her research interests include the theory and practice of parallel computing which include data structures, frameworks, implementations, programming tools and their applications. The link to her website is: [Prof Yihan's site](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~yihans/) which includes links to her research publications and her work on parallel tree structures.  

## About My Project

My project revolves around the theory and implementation of the parallel Breadth First Search algorithm. A sequential BFS algorithm explores a graph with a starting node by using a FIFO data structure, a queue, that allows those items first added to it to be the first removed from it. At every vertice its neighbors are added to the queue and after all neighbors of the current vertice are added the new current vertice will be taken from the front of the queue. By using a queue the algorithm explores the graph by level or “breadth” in order of increasing distance from the source node. 
My project centers on implementing a parallel BFS algorithm with faster execution than a sequential BFS algorithm through various optimizations, investigating the connection between parallel BFS algorithms and single source shortest path algorithms, such as ​​Dijkstra's algorithm, and shortcutting for wide-diameter graphs that can help speed up the traversal of these graphs by the BFS algorithm.
