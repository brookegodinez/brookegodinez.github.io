Hi everyone, as of writing this I am currently working on this project but please check back because at the end of the project I will be linking my final report and to my code! As an update to my project I am currently working on fixing a memory error, this project extensively uses c++ pointers to allocate arrays so memory errors like this are pretty enevitable but it allows me to practice my problem solving skills!
